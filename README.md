============

I'll store the code I write at Hacker School (https://www.hackerschool.com/) during summer 2013 in this repo.

log of awesome HS things:

6/4/2013: I finished a chunk of python code today! It was the first of the Matasano Crypto Challenges (http://www.matasano.com/articles/crypto-challenges/), and it was pretty fun.  However, per the rules of these challenges, I can't post my code here.  On to challenge #2!

6/5/2013:  4 crypto challenges down!  Got a code review (it was totally awesome).  Went over some real analysis in the afternoon, for a change of pace.  All good times..

6/10/2013:  5 crypto challenges completed!  In the challenge 6 vs. Alyssa matchup, however, Challenge 6 is ahead.  Let's hope this changes very, very soon!
